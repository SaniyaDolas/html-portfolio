    <p>A dive into the waves of grief and joy . This movie beautifully shows the relationship between a father and daughter & succesfully traverses all the emotions that can be emoted. The movie makes you smile,sob,reminisce and wonder possibilities!<br/>
    Rating: 4/5 </p>
    <h3>Anvatt</h3>

    <p>This is a marathi film in the genre of horror and pyschological thriller . As hard as it tries to give a valueable message to the viewers through the eerie vibes , It failed to build the suspense and fear for me.

    <P>The name stands for "My Fault" in Spanish but hey! It definitely wasn't my fault that I watched this movie.<br/>
    It wouldn't get off my fyp on instagram , so there I was....a prey to peer pressure.
Definitely no regrets :-) <br/>
It is a good movie , complete smut book/wattpad vibes (No complains)
The actor is FINE , the actress is FINE <br/>
the story?? fine still apart from the fact that they're step siblings (had to pass that ig)
<br/>
Overall a good watch!
(ps. I was convinced it'd be cringe but thanfully is not)<br/>Rating : 3.54282/5
